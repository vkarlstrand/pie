# Project in Information Engineering

## Demos
- `demo.ipynb` - Demonstration with loading of data, training, validation, testing, attack and detection.

## Files
- `data.py` - Functionality to handle and load data.
- `classify.py` - Functions to train and test classifier.
- `attack.py` - Functions and classes for adversarial attacks.
- `detect.py` - Functions and methods for detecting adversarial attacks.
- `plot.py` - Functions to plot and visualize data
- `utils.py` - Other utility functions

## Folders
- `/data` - Holding data and .csv files with information about how data is partitioned into training, validation and test.
- `/checkpoints` - Holds saved models and training logs from training the classifier.
- `/models` - Folder with DNN models, in particular the EfficientNet.
- `/attacked_images` - Saved original images, attacked images, gradients together with labels.
